# Steam-VR-Plugin-Vive-Controller-Wrapper
LAST UPDATED VERSION: Steam VR Plugin 2.0.1, Unity 2018.2.10f1  
This may work on more recent versions, I will update to whatever versions I am using.

Steam VR's new action system is great for different input compatabilities but if your developing only for the Vive controllers it can be a headache. Use this script to get input similar to pre-action era Steam VR. This wrapper is intended to work with the default VR bindings Steam has that can be seen in their demo scene Interactions_Example upon downloading their plugin. More description is given in the file. Attach the scrip to SteamVR's Camera Rig Prefab and it should work with the default bindings! The line renderer is not currently working. Feel free to use and amend this code to suit your needs!
